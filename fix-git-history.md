# Fix Git History with Blocked Secrets

## Problem
GitHub detected a Docker token in commit `c197cd5ccd7882cbd1d78dbedf3680278b29256f` and is blocking all pushes.

## Solution: Create Clean Branch (Required)

The problematic commit is in Git history, so we need to create a fresh branch without it.

### Step 1: Create orphan branch (clean history)
```powershell
# Create new branch with no history
git checkout --orphan clean-main

# Add all current files to new branch
git add .

# Make initial commit on clean branch
git commit -m "Initial commit - TeamSphere application"
```

### Step 2: Replace main branch
```powershell
# Force push clean branch to replace main
git push origin clean-main:main --force
```

### Step 3: Switch to new main
```powershell
# Delete old local main branch
git branch -D main

# Create new main branch from clean-main
git checkout -b main

# Set upstream
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

### Step 4: Cleanup (Updated)
```powershell
# Delete the clean-main branch locally (no longer needed)
git branch -D clean-main

# Note: No need to delete from remote since it was never pushed as a separate branch
# We used clean-main:main which directly overwrote the main branch
```

## Status Check Commands
```powershell
# Check current branch
git branch

# Check remote status
git remote -v

# Check if GitHub Actions are ready
git log --oneline -3

# Verify repository is clean
git status
```

## Next Steps After Clean History
1. **Add Docker Hub secrets to GitHub** (via web interface)
2. **Setup self-hosted runner** for GitHub Actions
3. **Test workflow** by making a small change and pushing

Your repository now has clean history without blocked secrets!
